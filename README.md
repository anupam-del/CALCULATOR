# CALCULATOR
Description:
This project involves creating a fully functional calculator web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It emphasizes DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic arithmetic logic. The calculator supports both button-based and keyboard input for operations.

Key Features:

Input parsing and dynamic updates

DOM event listeners for UI interactions

Keyboard input handling

Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

Error handling (invalid inputs, division by zero, etc.)

Goal:
To help learners solidify their understanding of front-end web development by building a responsive and interactive tool using JavaScript logic and DOM APIs.
